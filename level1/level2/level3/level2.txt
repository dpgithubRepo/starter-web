Modules
Initializr uses "modules", which are code snippets or files (or both) that will be included in the archive.

The modernizr module, for instance, adds the following line in index.html:

<script src="js/libs/modernizr-2.0.min.js"></script>

and also adds modernizr-2.0.min.js in the js/libs directory.

If you want to add a module to your archive, just add the name of that module as a GET parameter:

http://www.initializr.com/builder?print&jquery&modernizr

All the current available modules can be found on this Github.
