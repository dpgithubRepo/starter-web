About Initializr
Initializr is here to kick-start the development of your new projects. It generates templates based on HTML5 Boilerplate by allowing you to choose which parts you want or don't want from it. A responsive template has also been added to start from a basic design instead of a blank page.




Initializr is an HTML5 templates generator to help you getting started with a new project based on HTML5 Boilerplate. It generates for you a clean customizable template with just what you need to start!

Hey everyone! Initializr is going to retire at the end of 2017. I'd recommend using H5BP or Bootstrap directly instead. It doesn't take that long to combine them together and you'll get more up-to-date versions of those. Thank you for using Initializr all these years! ❤️
